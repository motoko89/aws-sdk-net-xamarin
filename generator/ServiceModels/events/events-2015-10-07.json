When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream.\n            You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. \n            For example, you can configure rules to:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for\n                    detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the \n            <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events\">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.</p>\n      ",

To invoke a command on\n            multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code>\n            field.</p>\n        <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch\n            Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources,\n            CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data\n            streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles\n            that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For\n            more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html\">Authentication\n                and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User\n                Guide</i>.</p>\n        <p>If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using\n                <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's\n            event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the\n            other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you\n            run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your\n            account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as\n            a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged.
