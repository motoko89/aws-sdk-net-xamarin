You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each\n            watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in <code>Preset</code> for the\n            current output.</p>\n        <p>Watermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them \n            in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, \n            the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings \n            in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark \n            that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the \n            fourth one covers the third.</p>\n      ",
