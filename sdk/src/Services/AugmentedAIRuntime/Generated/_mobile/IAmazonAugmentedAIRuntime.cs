    /// Amazon Augmented AI (Augmented AI) (Preview) is a service that adds human judgment

    ///  
    /// <para>
    /// From fraudulent bank transaction identification to document processing to image analysis,
    /// machine learning models can be trained to make decisions as well as or better than
    /// a human. Nevertheless, some decisions require contextual interpretation, such as when
    /// you need to decide whether an image is appropriate for a given audience. Content moderation
    /// guidelines are nuanced and highly dependent on context, and they vary between countries.
    /// When trying to apply AI in these situations, you can be forced to choose between "ML
    /// only" systems with unacceptably high error rates or "human only" systems that are
    /// expensive and difficult to scale, and that slow down decision making.
